# Data-Science-Assignment-Grp15
## Introduction
### For this WIA1007 Introduction to Data Science course assignment, we utilized a comprehensive automotive dataset sourced from Kaggle to investigate the primary factors that influence used car valuations. Our problem statement focuses on identifying how variables like mileage, brand origin, and car age affect market prices, with the goal of providing data-driven insights for potential buyers and sellers. Through our analysis, we successfully categorized local versus foreign market trends and established clear depreciation patterns that can guide more informed purchasing decisions.

## Conclusion
### In conclusion, our Exploratory Data Analysis has successfully unveiled the primary drivers of car depreciation within the Malaysian market. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, we were able to move beyond raw numbers to identify meaningful socio-economic patterns in vehicle valuation.

### Key Takeaways
The Power of Origin: Brand origin serves as the strongest predictor of depreciation speed; while Foreign (Continental) cars command higher initial prices, they experience a much steeper value drop compared to Local (Proton/Perodua) brands.

Mileage Milestones: Mileage does not impact all cars equally. We observed that Foreign cars often hit a "price cliff" after 100,000 km, likely due to buyer concerns over post-warranty maintenance costs, whereas Local cars maintain a more linear and stable value retention.

Age vs. Utility: The analysis confirms that for local brands, the "utility value" (the car's ability to provide low-cost transport) acts as a price floor, preventing their resale value from crashing as severely as luxury imports.

### Final Recommendation
For a budget-conscious buyer, the data suggests that Perodua and Proton models remain the safest investments for retaining value over 5–7 years. Conversely, the best "value-for-money" luxury experience is found by purchasing Foreign models that have already crossed the 5-year or 100,000 km mark, effectively letting the first owner absorb the most aggressive phase of depreciation.
